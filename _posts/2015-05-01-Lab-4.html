#Python and Matlab

##Why do we use Python and Matlab (instead of java, C, C++, R) ?

1. Compare to other programming languages, Python and Matlab are easy to learn.
2. It is convenient to perform matrix and numerical computation with Python and Matlab.

For more details, see following:

##Python vs Matlab

###Advantages of Python
Read [this](http://www.pyzo.org/python_vs_matlab.html) and [this](http://phillipmfeldman.org/Python/Advantages_of_Python_Over_Matlab.html)

###Disadvantages of Python

To get similar functionality in Python as Matlab, we need to find too many packages. You'll need the NumPy, SciPy and Matplotlib packages. Scipy is a package that has the goal of providing all the other functionality of Matlab, including those in the Matlab toolboxes (which would cost you extra in Matlab). Simulink, however, is one example which is not covered in Python. If you depend on it, you should probably stick to Matlab. Maybe in the future a Python alternative will be created.


###Advantages of Matlab

Read [this](http://www.pyzo.org/python_vs_matlab.html)

1. It has a solid amount of functions.
2. Simulink is a product for which there is no good alternative yet.
3. It might be easier for beginners, because the package includes all you need, while in Python you need to install extra packages and an IDE.
4. It has a large scientific community; it is used on many universities.


###Disadvantages of Matlab

Read [this](http://www.pyzo.org/python_vs_matlab.html). In "The problem with Matlab" Section.
