#Cloud Storage

###Why is github not used like dropbox for cloud storage?
 - Github is not as easy as Dropbox or similar services for that purpose.
 - Github could not save a large amount of data (over 1G). [Reference](https://help.github.com/articles/what-is-my-disk-quota/#file-and-repository-size-limitations)
 - The free accounts can only have public repositories in github, so you would also need to pay to keep your private documents on there. Dropbox and such do provide this for free.
 - The more public nature of Github makes us assume takedowns would be more frequent for illegal content sharing.
 - Github is not marketed towards this goal. Github offers all of the distributed revision control and source code management (SCM) functionality of Git as well as adding its own features. Most people would not think of using it for cloud storage.

###Cloud Storage Platforms (free)
 - [Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com/)
 - [One Drive](https://onedrive.live.com/about/en-us/)
 - [Google Drive](https://www.google.com/drive/)
 - [Flickr](https://www.flickr.com/)
 - [Swift Stack](https://swiftstack.com/)

###Private Cloud Storage
 - Private cloud storage, also called internal cloud storage, is a service delivery model for storage within a large enterprise. Internal cloud storage runs on a dedicated infrastructure in the data center, offering the same scalability benefits of public cloud storage to corporate departments and partners while addressing security and performance concerns. 

###Add a collaborator
Now, you can find the repository on your github webpage https://github.com/\<username\>/\<name of your repository\>. By clicking the “+” button at the top right, you can add collaborators to this repository.

###Add & Edit a file
To do any changes to the repository, such as add or edit a file, you just need to modify the local repository. The GitHub will automatically detect the changes that you’ve made and you can synchronize the changes to the online repository by clicking the “commit to gh-pages” and “Sync” button using the GitHub.

For example,

 - To add an image to the img folder, just add the new image to the local folder on your computer. Then commit and synchronize the changes using the GitHub IDE.
 - To edit a file, say config.yml, you can open it locally with a text editor, edit it. Then commit and synchronize the changes using the GitHub IDE. You can also edit a file by open it on your github webpages and make some changes.

###Setup project-pages
To create your github pages, the only file that you need to modify is the config.yml. Make the changes accordding to the instructions in the comment. Then your Project Pages will be available at http(s)://\<username\>.github.io/\<projectname\>. It may take a few seconds for the webpage to appear.

###Make a post
You can make a post by creating a .markdown file in the posts folder. For the instructions on how to make posts, click [here](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/posts/).
