#Cloud Storage

###Why is github not used like dropbox for cloud storage?
 - Github is not as easy as Dropbox or similar services for that purpose.
 - Github could not save a large amount of data (over 1G). [Reference](https://help.github.com/articles/what-is-my-disk-quota/#file-and-repository-size-limitations)
 - The free accounts can only have public repositories in github, so you would also need to pay to keep your private documents on there. Dropbox and such do provide this for free.
 - The more public nature of Github makes us assume takedowns would be more frequent for illegal content sharing.
 - Github is not marketed towards this goal. Github offers all of the distributed revision control and source code management (SCM) functionality of Git as well as adding its own features. Most people would not think of using it for cloud storage.

###Cloud Storage Platforms (free)
 - [Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com/)
 - [One Drive](https://onedrive.live.com/about/en-us/)
 - [Google Drive](https://www.google.com/drive/)
 - [Flickr](https://www.flickr.com/)
 - [Swift Stack](https://swiftstack.com/)

###Private Cloud Storage
 - Private cloud storage, also called internal cloud storage, is a service delivery model for storage within a large enterprise. Internal cloud storage runs on a dedicated infrastructure in the data center, offering the same scalability benefits of public cloud storage to corporate departments and partners while addressing security and performance concerns. 

###Example: how to use Dropbox
 - Go to [https://www.dropbox.com/install](https://www.dropbox.com/install) to download the Dropbox.
 - Go to [https://www.dropbox.com/](https://www.dropbox.com/) to get your Dropbox account if you do not have one and then install the Dropbox in your computer.
 - You will have a local folder named Dropbox automatically. At the same time The website [https://www.dropbox.com/home](https://www.dropbox.com/home) can also show the content of files you stored in local "Dropbox" folder.
 - In local Dropbox folder, you could operate the files in folder just as other regular folders. In the website, you could share the folder with other person who can see the files you stored in this folder.

###APIs for Data Storage Platforms
 - A data storage platforms APIs is an application program interface that connects a locally-based application to a cloud-based storage system, so that a user can send data to it and access and work with data stored in it. To the application, the cloud storage system is just another target device, like tape or disk-based storage.

###Security
 - The concept of the cloud computing storage can be found [here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_computing_security)
 - We face many riskes when we use the cloud storage platform. Reference [here](https://gigaom.com/2014/12/15/pro-tip-if-you-use-cloud-storage-bring-your-own-security/)
